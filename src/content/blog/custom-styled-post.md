# Welcome to Our Custom Styled Blog

This post demonstrates the custom CSS styles we've added to enhance the appearance of our blog posts.

## Headings Look Great

As you can see, our headings now have a nice color and a bottom border to make them stand out.

### Even Smaller Headings are Styled

We've made sure that all levels of headings are properly styled for a consistent look.

## Paragraphs and Lists

Our paragraphs now have better line height and spacing, making them easier to read. Here's an example of a list:

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

1. Numbered item one
2. Numbered item two
3. Numbered item three

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. We've styled it with a left border and italic text to make it stand out from the rest of the content.

## Code Blocks

Inline `code` looks great, and so do code blocks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

## Images

Images are now responsive and have rounded corners:

## Conclusion

With these custom styles, our blog posts now look more polished and are easier to read. Feel free to adjust the styles further to match your preferences!
